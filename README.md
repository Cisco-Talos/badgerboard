# Badgerboard

Badgerboard is an open source example implementation of a hardware/software solution that can lift traffic from a Schneider Electric X80 backplane into "normal" network traffic that can be inspected and acted upon by various network visiblity security solutions, such as Snort.

## Background

This research is designed to show the accessibility of backplane network visibility with fairly simple tooling. Ideally this would be adopted by device vendors and the traffic exposed in an easy to consume manner for network visibility and security tooling. If these device vendors offered a device that would expose this traffic, end users could adopt this visibility easily, security vendors could integrate inspection for the protocols, and the community would benefit as a whole. 

## What this is
- Proof of concept
- Proof that the engineering effort required for a working solution is easily achievable

## What this isn't
- Fully Engineered solution
- Ready for production
- Actively supported

## More information / Technical documentation

This code represents the proof of concept state of the research. More information can be found in the accompanying [blog post](blog.talosintelligence.com/badgerboard-research).

# Hardware

This is data exported from Xilinx Vivado suite. The Verilog code can be found directly in the `ip_repo` folder under hdl. All other files can be assumed to have been generated by Vivado directly. Many of these files are constraints about the Arty-A7 board itself and contains information required to place and route logic directly to the FPGA. The `drivers` folder in `ArtyBackplane` contains the generated C code for interacting with the peripheral once it has been synthesized. This is already found in the exported Vitis package and should not need to be moved elsewhere, but may be easier to find in this current location.

This code is provided as a reference of the required interrupt handling that is required to happen if a user decides to use a softcore implementation on the FPGA. Due to each softcore implementation being slightly different this is just a reference of what you may see in a tool like Xilinx Vitis once you have settled on a hardware design implementation. Once a user has built the hardware implementation in Vivado and moved to Vitis, all of the generated code should already be populated for the user. Once the code has been populated, this code can be heavily relied upon as a reference implementation.

The most important code is the setup of the various UDP buffers for sending data and then the `BackplaneReaderInterrupt` code which handles when the `BackplaneReader` peripheral signals an interrupt signaling that data is ready.
